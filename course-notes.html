          <h3>How to download your notes</h3>

          <p>You will need to have GitHub Desktop installed on your computer. If you have not read <a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>, please do that first.</p>

          <ol class="setup">
            <li>Click the "Clone in Desktop" icon <img src="images/clone-in-desktop.png" alt="Clone in Desktop icon" class="inline-icon" /> in the <a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/course-notes">course-notes</a> repository.</li>

            <li>If you receive an alert asking you to launch GitHub Desktop, click "Launch Application".</li>

            <li>When prompted to save the repository, click "Clone". Be sure to note the directory path where you are saving this on your computer.</li>
          </ol>

          <h4>Troubleshooting</h4>

          <p>If you are re-directed to the GitHub Desktop web site when you attempt to clone a repository, log out of GitHub Desktop (login details are under GitHub Desktop > Preferences), then log in again. Do the same with your GitHub account on the web. Repeat the steps above.</p>

          <h3>How to update your notes</h3>

          <p>If you "watch" this repo on GitHub, every time the notes have been changed or updated, a notice will appear on your main page feed. When this happens:</p>

          <ol class="setup">
            <li>Open GitHub Desktop.</li>

            <li>Select the "notes" repository in the left column.</li>

            <li>Click "Sync" in the top, right corner.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>The most recent set of notes (and any updates to previous notes) will be downloaded to your computer.</p>

          <h3>How to review your notes</h3>

          <p>All of the notes are written in <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> (and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>). This is to help become familiar with the code you will be writing, in addition to learning the content contained within the notes themselves.</p>

          <p>There are two ways you can review the notes:</p>

          <ol class="setup">
            <li>View the notes as they are <strong>formatted for the web</strong>. Open one of the files in <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a> (or another web browser) by selecting <em>File</em>, then <em>Open File</em>. This is the best way to review slides you may have missed in class so you can supplement your handwritten notes.</li>

            <li>View the <strong>text and code</strong> used to create the <code>.html</code> documents. Open one of the files in your text editor. You can do this by right-clicking (ctrl-click) on the notes repo in GitHub Desktop and select <em>Open in Atom</em> (if you are using Atom). If you are using another text editor, select <em>Open in Finder</em>, then drag-and-drop the files onto your text editor's icon. You can also open the files through the text editor's <em>Open</em> menu.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Having access the notes in this format also gives you something to tinker with.</p>

          <p>The more code you see and play with, the more comfortable you should become.</p>

        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>

        <article>
          <h4>Can I view them online? What is the URL for these notes?</h4>

          <p>No.</p>

          <p>I purposely do not set up as a web site so you will download them and play with the code. If the pages were easily accessible, no one would bother looking into what makes them work.</p>

          <p>I want you get familiar with viewing code using a web browser and a text editor. See how the pages look in different browsers like <a href="https://getfirefox.com">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a> and <a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>. Can you spot differences? Try making changes to the code.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>What if I break the code?</h4>

          <p>That is okay! Do it! Break it! You will learn more from breaking and fixing than doing everything perfect the first time.</p>

          <p>If you break the code, you can always revert to a working copy.</p>

          <p>To do so, open GitHub Desktop and select the "notes" repository in the left column. Next, click the tab which displays the text <em>uncommitted changes</em>. This will reveal a list of files which have been changed.</p>

          <p>Select the files you want to restore. Select <em>Repository</em> from the menu, then <em>Discard Changes to Selected Files</em>.</p>

          <p>This will restore the "broken" file(s) to a working version.</p>
