        <h2 class="break">Materials</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>Required Textbooks</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Duckett, Jon. (2011). <em><a href="http://htmlandcssbook.com/">HTML &amp; CSS: Design and Build Web Sites</a></em> Indianapolis, IN: Wiley.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Additional readings, lecture notes, code examples and resources will be added to the <a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/">course repo</a>.</p>

          <p>I strongly recommended purchasing a physical copy of <em>HTML &amp; CSS</em>. When learning to code, a published reference is essential. Specifications and best practices change over time. Online resources may not be up-to-date.</p>

          <p>Also, sometimes flipping through a book will lead you to discover information which may be overlooked when using the search feature in an e-book.</p>

          <h3>Optional Reading</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Cederholm, Dan. (2015). <em><a href="http://abookapart.com/products/css3-for-web-designers">CSS for Web Designers, Second Edition</a></em>. New York, NY: A Book Apart.</li>

            <li>Duckett, Jon. (2014). <em><a href="http://javascriptbook.com/">Javascript &amp; jQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development</a></em>. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley.</li>

            <li>Jehl, Scott. (2014). <em><a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design">Responsible Responsive Design</a></em>. New York, NY: A Book Apart.</li>

            <li>Marcotte, Ethan. (2014). <em><a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">Responsive Web Design, Second Edition</a></em>. New York, NY: A Book Apart.</li>

            <li>Verou, Lea. (2015). <em>CSS Secrets: Better Solutions to Everyday Web Design Problems</em>. Sebastopol, CA: O'Reilly Media.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>These books are not required, but recommended for those who want to explore web design and development further. The CSS-related texts show how to design creatively for the web. <em>JavaScript &amp; jQuery</em> tackles basic programming and how to add interactivity. The responsive design books provide detail on how to prepare accessible/mobile web sites.</p>


          <h4 class="break">Tip: Buying Textbooks</h4>

          <p>Buy the <a href="http://amzn.to/1w0u4rP">Duckett Web Design package</a> from Amazon. This includes both <em>HTML &amp; CSS</em> and <em>Javascript &amp; jQuery</em> for $38 &mdash; less than you would pay retail for the <em>HTML &amp; CSS</em> text alone.</p>

          <p>I use both books for <strong>Programming for Interactivity (JMM 422)</strong>. If you choose to take the next class in this sequence, your textbooks will be covered.</p>

          <p>If you are interested in any of the (optional) <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/">A Book Apart</a> texts, please let me know and I will try my best to get a discount code from the publisher.</p>
        </article>


        <article>
          <h3>Software</h3>

          <p>Please read "<a href="../getting-started.html">Getting Started</a>" for details regarding the software to be installed. Students are expected to have these applications/plugins installed by the start of the second week of class.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://goo.gl/k3JDp">Web Developer Toolbar</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://goo.gl/AkqVyY">uBlock</a></li>
            <li>A text/code editor (<a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a>, <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a>)</li>
            <li><a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> (and a <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> account)</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Additional resources</h4>

          <p>You will need a to register a domain name (free-$15+) later in the semester for your final portfolio.</p>

          <p>If you include multimedia in your projects, you will need access to Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, etc.). You do not need to purchase Creative Suite as the software is available on computers in School of Communication labs and Richter Library's Digital Media Lab.</p>

        <h2>Coursework</h2>

        <p>Students are required to attend and participate in class, complete one unannounced, open-note quiz, one self-guided assignment, two projects and build and present a final portfolio.</p>

        <article>
          <h3 class="break">Requirements</h3>

          <p><strong>Attendance / Class Participation (10 points):</strong> Activities include discussion, code walkthroughs and pair programing exercises.</p>

          <p><strong>Quiz (10 points):</strong> Topics may include (but are not limited to): readings, Internet and web knowledge, using git/GitHub, site architecture, best practices. Memorizing HTML or CSS is not necessary. Students may refer to handwritten notes during this quiz.</p>

          <p><strong>git &amp; GitHub (10 points):</strong> Set up your GitHub account, a repository to host web pages and demonstrate an understanding of git and GitHub. Step-by-step instructions are provided for this self-guided task.</p>

          <p><strong>HTML (15 points):</strong> Construct a CV/resume using only HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) to demonstrate understanding of well-structured, semantic web documents.</p>

          <p><strong>CSS (15 points):</strong> Style a CV/resume using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) to demonstrate understanding of web design  fundamentals including visual design, interactivity and responsiveness.</p>

          <p><strong>Portfolio (40 points):</strong> Develop a personal web site which reflects one's professional pursuits. The portfolio may include work from other classes, internships or material related to one's field of study. The portfolio is cumulative; it should reflect a student's abilities to create content in an interactive, accessible and responsive manner, as well as the technical know-how needed to do so. The project should also demonstrate growth in the the student's skill set from the first two projects (HTML, CSS).</p>

          <p>Students are <strong>required</strong> to present the portfolio on the date of the section's final exam. Students who choose not to or fail to present their portfolios on this date will incur in a 10-point deduction.</p>

          <p><strong>Total points possible: 100.</strong></p>

          <h4>Extra Credit</h4>

          <p>If a web-related talk, meetup, workshop or collaborative effort presents itself during the semester, I will consider offering extra credit. As of now, there are no opportunities.</p>

        <h2>Attendance Policy</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>Attendance is required.</h3>

          <p>Absences related to a medical condition will be excused <em>only</em> with a dated note from a doctor. Excused absences may be granted to students who are required to conduct official University business, make a court appearance, celebrating religious holy days (see below) or tending to an urgent circumstance involving immediate family.</p>

          <p>In all cases, documentation must be presented no later than the subsequent class after the student's absence.</p>

          <p>Absences related to job interviews will only be excused with at least 48 hours notice.</p>

          <p>If you have a legitimate, serious circumstance (i.e. death / illness in the immediate family, mental / physical health issues, etc.) which causes you to miss class or not perform to the best of your abilities, <strong>please do not hesitate to contact me privately</strong>. Your health and well-being comes first, but you need to be proactive and seek assistance before a situation spirals out of control.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Religious Holy Days</h3>

          <p>It is the student's obligation to provide faculty members with notice of the dates they will be absent for religious holy days, preferably before the beginning of classes but no later than the end of the first three (3) class days.</p>

          <p>Absences due to observance of religious holy days not pre-arranged within the first three class days may be considered unexcused and there is no obligation to allow any make up work, including examinations. Missing a class due to travel plans associated with a particular religious holy day does not constitute an excused absence. The University's complete Religious Holy Day Policy can be found in the 2015-2016 Bulletin.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

          <p>Students who require accommodations are asked to register and present documentation from the Office of Disability Services. The Office of Disability Services (ODS) is located in the Academic Resource Center in Whitten University Center (N201).</p>

          <p>ODS staff can be reached at 305-284-2374 (voice), 305-284-3401 (TDD), 305-284-1999 (fax) or <a href="mailto:disabilityservices@miami.edu">disabilityservices@miami.edu</a>.</p>

          <p>Office hours are 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday.</p>

          <p>I am sensitive to personal privacy. If you prefer not to approach me in class with aforementioned documentation, please contact me via e-mail or come by office hours.</p>

        <h2 class="break">Classroom Etiquette</h2>

        <p>Students are expected to show respect for their peers and instructor. Always give your full attention to anyone speaking in class.</p>

        <p>Students should arrive on time in order to be adequately prepared for a lecture, walkthrough or pair programming exercise. Those arriving late or leaving early should do so in a quiet and respectful manner as to not disturb others.</p>

        <p><strong>Mobile devices are to be turned OFF and put away prior to class. Use of computers is permitted <em>only</em> for coding walkthroughs or pair programming sessions.</strong></p>

        <article>
          <h3>Notes</h3>

          <p>Note taking should be done with pen and paper. Studies show students who take notes longhand <a href="http://www.vox.com/2014/6/4/5776804/note-taking-by-hand-versus-laptop" class="source">remember more and have a better understanding of concepts</a>.</p>

          <p>All course notes and code examples will be posted in the <a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design">course repo</a>. If you miss a concept during lecture, obtain the content online and supplement your notes.</p>

          <p>Another reason to take notes: You will be permitted to use <em>only</em> your handwritten notes during a quiz.</p>

          <p>Photographing or recording (audio/video) of lectures is prohibited. (Florida law states you must have a person's consent; you don't have mine.)</p>

      <section>
        <h2>University Honor Code</h2>

        <p>Students are expected to abide by the <a href="http://miami.edu/sa/index.php/policies_and_procedures/student_rights_responsibilities/">University of Miami Honor Code</a>. The purpose of the Honor Code is to protect the academic integrity of the University by encouraging consistent ethical behavior in assigned coursework. <strong>Academic dishonesty of any kind, for whatever reason, will not be tolerated.</strong></p>

      <section>
        <h2>Academic Dishonesty</h2>

        <article>
          <h3>Web Ethics</h3>
          <p>Because of the open-source nature of the web, there are times when it is acceptable to use the work of other individuals. Web developers frequently share code or libraries, frameworks or design and artistic elements. However, not everything is free for the taking.</p>

          <p>The following actions are <strong>not</strong> acceptable in this course:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>linking to raw files (i.e. images, videos, scripts, etc.) not hosted on your own server</li>
            <li>making changes to another person's design and/or code and submitting it as your own work</li>
            <li>using copyrighted media (i.e. photos, graphics, multimedia, text)</li>
            <li>using proprietary source code</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Students caught doing any of the above, reproducing a web site design not their own and/or copying source code will be considered guilty of plagiarism. If the design and/or source code appears in the work of multiple students, all will be penalized.</p>

          <p>Additionally, students are not permitted to use programs which generate or format web pages using a graphical user interface (i.e. Adobe Dreamweaver, WordPress, etc.) or HTML and CSS frameworks. A few exceptions may be considered for the final portfolio and will be specified in class or course resources.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h3>On Plagiarism</h3>

          <p>No honest student wants to be guilty of the intellectual crime of plagiarism, even unintentionally. Therefore, we provide you with these guidelines so that you don't accidentally fall into the plagiarism trap.</p>

          <p>Plagiarism is the taking of someone else's words, work or ideas, and passing them off as a product of your own efforts. Plagiarism may occur when a person fails to place quotation marks around someone else's exact words, directly rephrasing or paraphrasing someone else's words while still following the general form of the original, and/or failing to issue the proper citation to one's source material.</p>

          <p>In student papers, plagiarism is often due to:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>turning in someone else's paper as one's own</li>
            <li>using another person's data or ideas without acknowledgment</li>
            <li>failing to cite a written source (printed or Internet) of information that you used to collect data or ideas</li>
            <li>copying an author's exact words and putting them in the paper without quotation marks</li>
            <li>rephrasing an author's words and failing to cite the source</li>
            <li>copying, rephrasing, or quoting an author's exact words and citing a source other than where the material was obtained
              <ul>
                <li>For example, using a secondary source which cites the original material, but citing only the primary material. This misrepresents the nature of the scholarship involved in creating the paper. If you have not read an original publication, do not cite it in your references as if you have!</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>using wording that is very similar to that of the original source, but passing it off as one's own</li>
          </ul>

          <p>The last item is probably the most common problem in student writing. It is still plagiarism if the student uses an author's key phrases or sentences in a way that implies they are his/her own, even if he/she cites the source.</p>

          <p>Simply put: <strong>DO. NOT. PLAGIARIZE.</strong></p>

          <p><strong>The penalty for academic dishonesty, plagiarism or lapses in web ethics will result in a zero (0) on the assignment submitted, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the Honor Council.</strong></p>
