        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>Creating web sites is a new experience for many students. Becoming skilled at web design is not about memorization or reading; it involves a lot of doing. The more you practice, the more confidence you will gain.</p>

        <p>I assume all students enter this course with zero knowledge about web design and digital fundamentals, such as how the Internet works. Students who have a strong computer literacy skills and/or knowledge of graphic design fundamentals may find some aspects of this course easy.</p>

        <p>Don't fear; we will go through this all step-by-step.</p>

        <h3>Advice from Former Students</h3>

        <p>It seems no listens when I detail what it takes to succeed in this course. Maybe feedback from former students will resonate more:</p>

        <p><q>It can be really intimidating at first, but once you learn the basics, it all falls into place. Don't fall behind in class! Take notes!</q></p>

        <p><q>Take time after each class to try and learn what was taught in that class. Listening is helpful, but coding isn’t a passive subject.</q></p>

        <p><q>Stay on top of the material and you will not only get a better grade, but actually enjoy the class more.</q></p>

        <p><q>[N]ever think it is enough to show up to class. Play more and practice more. That is the most important part of the process in studying web design.</q></p>

        <p><q>Print off all assignments and go through line-by-line to make sure you do everything.</q></p>

        <p><q>Start early on projects to give yourself enough time to build out the idea in your mind. Play around with the code and don’t be scared to try new things. Take advantage of office hours to ask questions and get one-on-one help.</q></p>

        <p><q>DO NOT STOP CODING. Don't take breaks in between assignments because coding is like learning a [foreign] language. You have to constantly speak it not to lose it or you'll find yourself back at square one too often.</q></p>

        <p><q>Practice coding even if you have no idea what you are doing. Breaking something seems to be a great way to learn.</q></p>

        <p><q>Do not get discouraged and keep trying. You will find yourself hitting many road blocks along the way, but once you figure out how to work past those issues, it is the most rewarding feeling.</q></p>

        <p><q>Correct and minimalistic coding is often better than trying something elaborate. Think small and add more after your skill level matches.</q></p>

        <h3>Advice from Your Professor</h3>

        <p>My turn. :)</p>

        <article>
          <h4>1. Read everything and follow instructions.</h4>

          <p>Coding requires attention to detail, focus and discipline. As you will see, one typo can break <em>everything</em>. Garbage in, garbage out.</p>

          <p>I provide detailed project rubrics so you can focus on understanding the material and applying it in your work. Students who use these as a checklist end up scoring (on average) one-and-a-half (1.5) points higher on the assignments than those who do not.</p>

          <p>That said, there are no copy-and-paste solutions. This course requires you to apply critical thinking, problem-solving skills and implement creative solutions. The instructions are there have you follow best practices, which help you avoid time-sucking mistakes. It is okay if it takes time to absorb some concepts; just make sure you give yourself enough time to meet deadlines.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>2. Practice</h4>

          <p>Learning to code is like learning to speak a foreign language or play an instrument. It requires practice to get better.</p>

          <p>You should spend at least 30 minutes a day coding. (If you want to spend more time, that's fine, too.)</p>

          <p>You don't have to undertake a massive project to build up your skill set. Code an example in your book. Build components of a web page (i.e. a story, images, table, navigation bar, etc.). Do a tutorial. Watch a video online and code along. Every little bit of code you write enhances your understanding and builds your confidence.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>3. Play and experiment</h4>

          <p>Building web sites can be a very creative endeavor; I often compare the experience to playing with LEGO. You're going to make a lot of weird-looking stuff at first. You will learn from your experiences -- good and bad -- and build off of them. Continuing with the LEGO analogy, you will eventually be able to create something like this:</p>

          <iframe width="620" height="349" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V-pgeBJZPjE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <p>Following tutorials and examples is good, but coding something <em>you</em> want to build is even better. Maybe you want to create a page for a student organization you are involved in, a favorite band or sports team, display art or poetry in digital form. If the content is related to something you enjoy, you are more likely to come up with creative ideas for presenting it and learn the solutions to do so.</p>

        <article>
          <h4>4. Ask questions</h4>

          <p>No one learns web design on their own. Everyone who builds sites shares knowledge, asks questions. If you are not clear about a concept or are looking for a better way to approach a problem, <strong>ASK</strong>. Ask your professor, classmates. Questions get everyone thinking about what is possible. We all learn from the answer.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>5. Be resourceful</h4>

          <p>There are millions? billions? of sites, tutorials and forums on how to build for the web. If you have run into a problem, chances are someone else in the world has encountered a similar one. The first step should always be reading  documentation. Searching a question-and-answer site such as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>. Do not assume the first link from a search engine will provide the best answer. Look at multiple sources to develop a solution.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>6. Don't panic</h4>

          <p>You will make mistakes. Your code will break. Things will not work as you will expect them to. This is guaranteed, 100 percent. Never get too frustrated. If you encounter a blocker during your daily coding session, put your code aside. Think about the problem. Revisit it the next day. Just remember to not panic.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>7. Fail</h4>

          <p>It is rare to code a new concept and make it work on the first try. Failing is part of the learning process.</p>

          <p>When you spend 30 minutes searching for what ends up being a typo, you will never make the same mistake again. When you spend hours doing something the hard way, you will ask yourself, "Is there a better way?".</p>

          <p>I try my best to provide advice that helps you avoid these situations (which I have experienced and <em>still</em> experience), but sometimes experiencing pain is positive. It helps you acquire a stronger skill set through problem solving.</p>
        </article>

        <article>
          <h4>8. Take advantage of one-on-one help outside of class.</h4>

          <p>I hold "hack night" every Wednesday evening (about 5-7 p.m., later if demand warrants). If you are stuck on a problem, this is the best time to work on it together. I also make myself available for extra hours in the evenings leading up to project deadlines.</p>

          <p>Come by to code on personal projects in a more relaxed setting (Coffee! Code!), share what you are working on. Coding has always been fun for me, and hack night is the best way to show that outside of a formal classroom.</p>
