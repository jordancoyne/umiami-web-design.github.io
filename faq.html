          <h3>Is your class hard?</h3>

          <p>I would say the course requires time and practice.</p>

          <p>I do not require a lot of coursework because the subject takes time to digest &mdash; especially it is new to you. The material  builds on itself, so keeping up is essential. Outside of class, you have to put in time to practice throughout the semester.</p>

          <h3>I'm not a tech person. Is this course for me?</h3>

          <p>Almost all of my former students come in with zero experience in coding or web design. Some students really thrive; some find coding isn't for them.</p>

          <p>I try to structure the course so students who fall into the latter category aren't crippled by a lack of digital skills. As long as you give an honest effort (practice frequently outside of class, turn in assignments on time, seek help when warranted), you will be fine.</p>

          <h3>I've done some web stuff before. Should I take this class?</h3>

          <p>Even for those with previous web experience, I think it is a course worth taking. You will only get better if you spend more time working on something &mdash; and if you take this course, you'll get credit for something you were willing to do on your own. :)</p>

          <p>As for how it relates to the knowledge you have:</p>

          <p>If you have worked with WordPress, this course gives you the tools to design/build/style your own templates. If you have built sites with Bootstrap, you better understand how and why it works. If you have some knowledge of HTML and/or CSS, I can help you refine your knowledge so your code is fundamentally better.</p>

          <h3>I'm on the waiting list. Do you think I'll get into your class?</h3>

          <p>I do not know. I have no insight as to who will drop the course. You just need to let the situation play out.</p>

          <p>If a spot does not open up this semester, try next semester. I usually teach three sections every Fall and Spring.</p>

          <p>You are also welcome to use any of my class notes posted to GitHub to learn on your own or come by Hack Night if you have questions.</p>

          <h3>Will we learn jQuery? JavaScript?</h3>

          <p>JavaScript and jQuery are not part of this course. I teach those concepts in <strong>Programming for Interactivity (JMM 422)</strong>.</p>

          <p>I have yet to teach a version of JMM 341 where there is enough time to cover either by the end of the semester. Most students prefer having the time to spend more time on HTML and CSS concepts, extra pair programming sessions or time to work on final projects.</p>

          <p>If there is time and enough students ask, I am willing to introduce jQuery (maybe JavaScript).</p>

          <p>Students who want to add JavaScript or jQuery to their final project are welcome to. I am happy to provide guidance at "hack night" or extra help sessions.</p>

          <h3>Do we have to be here the class before Spring Break?</h3>

          <p>Yes.</p>

          <h3>Can I present my portfolio early? I booked a flight home before our exam date.</h3>

          <p>No. If you are not present to share your portfolio on the university-scheduled exam date, you will forfeit 10 of the 40 points alotted for your final project.</p>

          <h3>Why is this web site so boring / ugly?</h3>

          <p>It is an example of content-driven design. The site's purpose is to be informative, not distract a user with unnecessary features.</p>

          <p>I only hope to make <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/people/jakob-nielsen/">Jakob Nielsen</a> smile.</p>
