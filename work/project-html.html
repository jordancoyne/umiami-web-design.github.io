      <section>
        <h3>Submission</h3>

        <p>By now you should have all required software installed on your computer and familiar with GitHub and GitHub Desktop. You should also have created a repository to host your web pages (<code>username.github.io</code>).</p>

        <p>Only one file &mdash; <code>resume.html</code> &mdash; is required for this assignment. You are to commit your résumé as <code>resume.html</code> to your <code>username.github.io</code> repo.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/project-html/issues">Create an issue</a> in the <code>project-html</code> repository with your <strong>full name</strong> and <strong>a link to your web page (<code>username.github.io/resume.html</code>)</strong> by the deadline. If you are unsure of how to submit, check the <a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/project-html/issues/1">example</a> provided in the Issues section.</p>

        <p><strong>Do not wait until the last minute to submit your URL.</strong></p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Grading</h3>

        <p>One quarter of a point (0.25) will be be deducted for each missing requirement as stated above. One quarter of a point (0.25) will be be deducted for <em>each</em> spelling, grammar or style error.</p>

        <p>A missed deadline (submitting the assignment, for instance, at 3:00:01 p.m.) will result in a two (2) point deduction for every day the assignment is late.</p>

        <p>Failure to submit the assignment to GitHub as detailed above will result in a five (5) point deduction. This includes an incorrect repo name and/or file name.</p>

        <p><small>(I use a computer script to clone and do an initial check of every student's work. If the script breaks, it means I have to do extra work to grade your assignment. Be thankful I don't grade incorrect submissions as a zero; better yet, just correctly submit your projects.)</small></p>

        <p><strong>Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council.</strong></p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>

        <p>Students who would like feedback are welcome to add their code to a <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle.net</a> instance. After pasting your code into the HTML section of the page, click 'Save' and e-mail me the unique URL jsfiddle generates.</p>

        <p>I will provide comments in code and any other thoughts on how to improve your résumé up to 48 hours before deadline.</p>

        <p>Please understand if many students ask for feedback by the deadline, there may be a backlog and it is possible I may not be able to offer comments before the final deadline.</p>

        <p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
