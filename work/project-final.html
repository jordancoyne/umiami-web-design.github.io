        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>Develop a personal web site which reflects your professional pursuits.</p>

        <p><strong>This assignment is worth 40 points.</strong></p>



        <p>The final portfolio may include works from other classes, extracurriculars or professional experiences related to your field of study. This may include photography, published articles, audio/video segments or graphic design samples.</p>

        <p>For students with a major outside the School of Communication, an alternative topic may be presented. Please discuss this with your professor before beginning work on the portfolio.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this project is to have a web site which you can present to prospective employers for internships or jobs.</p>


        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>Your site must contain a minimum of four (4) pages, but no more than eight (8). It must be hosted on GitHub and accessible via a domain name.</p>

        <p>You have the freedom to be creative in how you present your site, but it must exhibit best web design practices throughout. This includes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Well-organized code in <code>.html</code> and <code>.css</code> files</li>
          <li>Well-structured, valid HTML documents</li>
          <li>Effective presentation for web using CSS
            <ul>
              <li>Effective presentation of a résumé for print using CSS</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Proper site architecture</li>
          <li>Effective site navigation</li>
          <li>Properly formatted and sized web images</li>
          <li>No design sins</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The project should also demonstrate growth in your design and coding skill set from the first two projects.</p>

        <p>Your site must exhibit responsive design practices when accessed using a mobile device with a maximum screen width of 320 pixels. If you choose to include a résumé as part of the site, it must be printable. (You need a print style sheet only for the résumé.)</p>

        <p>Site responsiveness will be tested in Google Chrome's mobile device emulator with the following settings:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Device Model:</strong> iPhone 5 / Portrait</li>
          <li><strong>Screen:</strong> 320 x 568</li>
          <li><strong>Pixel Ratio:</strong> 2</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Failure to attempt a mobile and/or print style sheet (résumé only) will result in a five-point (5) deduction. I understand these are trickier concepts and may not come out perfect. But there is <strong>no excuse</strong> for not trying. (And no, simply  copying and pasting your style sheet into a <code>mobile.css</code> file does not constitute 'trying'.)</p>

        <p><strong>That's it!</strong></p>

        <p>Other than what is listed above, there are no minimum requirements for use of HTML or CSS elements as were set forth in the previous two assignments. (For instance, if you include a résumé in your portfolio site, you do not need to include the in-page navigation for each section.)</p>


        <h4>Javascript &amp; jQuery</h4>

        <p>Students who get into a groove designing portfolios often want to add interactive effects which are handled through JavaScript, jQuery or jQuery plugins. Those concepts are beyond the scope of this course. However, I do not want to discourage anyone from creating the best possible web site they can create.</p>

        <p>You may include these features on the condition your site <em>does not break</em>. It is a risk you take. If you attempt to include JavaScript or jQuery and are unsuccessful, be sure you have a backup plan in place.</p>

        <p>I will provide basic resources for those who may be interested in JavaScript or jQuery. Implementation may require you to learn a more outside of class, spend time reading documentation and/or prototyping. I am happy to answer JavaScript- or jQuery-related questions <em>outside of class</em>, during office hours or extra help sessions.</p>

        <p>Students who do not include JavaScript or jQuery will not be penalized. HTML and CSS can be challenging enough. You can still create a great web site without these additional elements. Do not feel pressured if your peers are trying something advanced; focus on proper HTML and CSS fundamentals.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>

        <p>The deadline for submission is based on the University of Miami final exam schedule. Projects are due prior to the start of their respective exam period, which is as follows:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Section 35: Wednesday, April 27, 2 p.m.</li>
          <li>Section R: Tuesday, May 3, 2 p.m.</li>
          <li>Section S: Thursday, April 28, 2 p.m.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Unfortunately, some sections get more time to work on the final project than others. Sorry. It is just how the schedule works out.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/project-final">Create an issue</a> in the <code>project-final</code> repository with your <strong>full name</strong> and <strong>a link to your domain name</strong> by the deadline. If you are unsure of how to submit, check the <a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/project-final/issues/1">example</a> provided in the Issues section.</p>

        <p><strong>Do not wait until the last minute to submit your URL.</strong></p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Presentation</h3>

        <p>You are required to present your portfolio on the date of your final exam. Presentations should be about five (5) minutes in duration.</p>

        <p>Topics you may choose to discuss:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Is there a unique, interactive feature you incorporated into your design?</li>
          <li>Why did you choose specific design elements?</li>
          <li>What aspect of designing your web site did you find most challenging?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Be prepared for fellow students (or your professor) to ask questions.</p>

        <p><strong>If links are not received by the start of the final class meeting, one (1) point will be deducted for every hour the assignment is late. Students who choose not to or fail to present their portfolios on this date will incur in a 10-point deduction.</strong></p>

        <p>During presentations, no laptops, mobile phones, devices, etc. will be permitted to be in use. Students are expected to be attentive and respectful of their peers. Those who are disruptive will be asked to leave and will forfeit their presentation points.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Academic Dishonesty &amp; Plagiarism</h3>

        <p>This should go without saying at this point, but we will repeat this so there is absolutely no confusion:</p>

        <p>Students enrolled in this course are expected to abide by the University of Miami Honor Code. Academic dishonesty of any kind, for whatever reason, will not be tolerated. Plagiarism is the taking of someone else's words, work, or ideas, and passing them off as a product of your own efforts. Improper copying or reproduction of web site design and/or source code will also be considered an act of plagiarism.</p>

        <p>Students are not permitted to use programs which generate or format web pages using a graphical user interface (i.e. Adobe Dreamweaver, WordPress, etc.) or HTML and CSS frameworks. Exceptions are specified in the <a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/resources">resources</a> repository.</p>

        <p><strong>Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed above and in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council.</strong></p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Grading</h3>

        <p>Failure to meet requirements will result in a two-point (2) deduction.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Does the site meet the minimum page requirement></li>
          <li>Is the site accessible via a domain name?</li>
          <li>Do HTML pages validate using the W3C Validator?</li>
          <li>Is code within <code>.html</code> and <code>.css</code> legible, organized?</li>
          <li>Is the content structured with HTML5 structural tags?</li>
          <li>Are semantic tags properly used?</li>
          <li>Is there effective navigation throughout the site?</li>
          <li>Do interactive elements respond as expected?</li>
          <li>Are images saved in a proper format and reasonable file size?</li>
          <li>Are images and links working?</li>
          <li>Are special characters encoded?</li>
          <li>Does the text reflect correct style, spelling and grammar?</li>
          <li>Are files organized using a site architecture?</li>
          <li>Are files named properly for system portability?</li>
          <li>Does the printed resume take best practices into account?</li>
          <li>Does the site render well in a mobile setting?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Failure to attempt a mobile style sheet will result in a five-point (5) deduction. Failure to attempt a print style sheet for a résumé page will also result in a five-point (5) deduction. (<em>Attempt</em> means you get these aspects of the working, but the actual execution, design may need improvement. Again, there is no excuse for not trying.)</p>

        <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Follow instructions. Print this page and mark off each requirement as you meet it. This will provide you with assurance you have completed what is being asked.</p>
