        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <p>Using a corrected version of your HTML résumé, create a styled version for the web and print using CSS.</p>

        <p>You have the freedom to be creative in how you present your résumé. It should demonstrate proper visual design techniques, utilize an organized site architecture and adhere to best practices.</p>

        <p><strong>This assignment is worth 15 points.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Follow instructions. When you finish your first attempt at coding, print this page and mark off each requirement you have met. Fix your code/résumé to meet the requirements. This will provide you with assurance you have completed what is being asked.</p>

      <section>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>

        <p>By now, you should have taken the time to correct the HTML version of your résumé based on feedback from your professor.</p>

        <p>We will (still) be looking for the requirements of a well-structured HTML document set forth the first project, including:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Valid HTML (checked using the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validator</a>)</li>
          <li>Presence of HTML5 structural tags (i.e. <code>header</code>, <code>nav</code>, <code>main</code>, <code>section</code>, <code>article</code>, <code>footer</code>) as needed</li>
          <li>Proper use of heading (<code>h1</code>-<code>h6</code>) tags</li>
          <li>Properly encoded HTML entities (where necessary)</li>
          <li>Use of appropriate tags for marking up respective content</li>
          <li>Does not use presentational elements (i.e. <code>b</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>hr</code>, etc.)</li>
          <li>Does not use ornamental characters (i.e. bullets, pipes, etc.)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To demonstrate proficiency in site architecture, your files should:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Be organized using directories (i.e. a <code>css</code> directory for <code>.css</code> files, <code>img</code> directory for images)</li>
          <li>Be named according to best practices for portability among file systems</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To demonstrate understanding in CSS, visual and interactive design principles, your page should:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Display well in Google Chrome</li>
          <li>Exhibit use of box model properties (i.e. margin, border, padding)</li>
          <li>Demonstrate two positioning techniques (i.e. center a containing element, floats, position, etc.)</li>
          <li>Include two, well-paired web fonts from a provider such as <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a></li>
          <li>Set colors for different link "states" (i.e. default, active, visited, hover)</li>
          <li>Keep content from stretching beyond 960 pixels</li>
          <li>Avoid "design sins" (see below)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To show an understanding of designing for different media, your project should incorporate a style sheet which makes your résumé appear as if it were created exclusively for print. It should:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Use a serif typeface</li>
          <li>Use print units (points, inches, centimeters, millimeters, etc.)</li>
          <li>Use only black and white</li>
          <li>Eliminate unnecessary interactive or multimedia elements</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In general, your document should:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>follow best practices as specified during lectures</li>
          <li>be free of spelling, grammatical and style errors</li>
          <li>be free of broken links</li>
          <li>be free of broken images</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you choose to include an image (a background or social media icons, for instance):</p>

        <ul>
          <li>you must have the rights to use it</li>
          <li>it must be included in your GitHub repo (no linking to an image or file hosted on another site)</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Design Sins</h3>

        <p>Your designs (web and print) should avoid the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Things that blink</li>
          <li>Warped photos</li>
          <li>Naked photos (photos lacking a border)</li>
          <li>Bulky borders, boxes</li>
          <li>Bad bullets</li>
          <li>Cheated margins</li>
          <li>Poorly aligned elements</li>
          <li>Centering everything</li>
          <li>Clutter</li>
          <li>Trapped white space</li>
          <li>Busy backgrounds</li>
          <li>Tacky, mismatched or illegible type</li>
          <li>Mismatched colors</li>
        </ul>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Submission</h3>

        <p>Approximately three files &mdash; <code>resume.html</code> and individual css files for your web and print versions &mdash; are required for this assignment. You may have more files if you choose to include images. Commit these files to your <code>username.github.io</code> repo.</p>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/project-css/issues">Create an issue</a> in the <code>project-css</code> repository with your <strong>full name</strong> and <strong>a link to your web page (<code>username.github.io/resume.html</code>)</strong> by the deadline. If you are unsure of how to submit, check the <a href="https://github.com/umiami-web-design/project-css/issues/1">example</a> provided in the Issues section.</p>

        <p><strong>Do not wait until the last minute to submit your URL.</strong></p>
      </section>


      <section>
        <h3>Grading</h3>

        <p>One quarter of a point (0.25) will be be deducted for projects that do not meet the presentational requirements. Failure to attempt a print style sheet will result in a two (2) point deduction.</p>

        <p>One half point (0.5) will be deducted for projects that do not meet the structural requirements. One half of a point (0.5) will be be deducted for <em>each</em> spelling, grammar or style error.</p>

        <p>You received feedback and had time to correct the errors in project one. <strong>Do not make the same mistakes again because now they will hit your grade twice as hard.</strong></p>

        <p>A missed deadline (submitting the assignment, for instance, at 3:00:01 p.m.) will result in a two (2) point deduction for every day the assignment is late.</p>

        <p>Failure to submit the assignment to GitHub as detailed above will result in a five (5) point deduction. This includes an incorrect repo name and/or file name.</p>

        <p><small>(I use a computer script to clone every student's work. If the script breaks, it means I have to do extra work to grade your assignment. Be thankful I don't grade incorrect submissions as a zero; better yet, just correctly submit your projects.)</small></p>

        <p><strong>Plagiarism or lapses in web ethics, as detailed in the course syllabus, will result in a zero (0) on the assignment, PLUS a 15-point penalty on your final grade and referral to the University of Miami Honor Council.</strong></p>

        <h3>Tips</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Sketch out how you want your résumé to look before starting. This will provide you with a visual reference as you code.</li>

          <li>Start styling from the top of your HTML document. Create the styles which will be inherited (<code>body</code>). Move on to the <code>header</code>, then <code>nav</code> ...</li>

          <li>Depending your design, you may have to add or modify HTML. You may decide to re-do the entire HTML document. This is okay. Make sure any change you make to the HTML validates before continuing with styling.</li>

          <li>If you are unsure where you left off with your GitHub repo (<code>username.github.io</code>), your can always delete the repository from your computer and re-clone it from GitHub. Make any necessary changes to <code>resume.html</code>, commit the files, then push to GitHub.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Feedback</h3>

        <p>Students who would like feedback are advised to come to office hours, "Hack Night" or extra hours for one-on-one help.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, not all issues can be worked on through <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle.net</a>. Fixing HTML <em>and</em> CSS can be a multi-step process. Explanations can be complex. I'm happy to try (again, up to 48 hours before deadline) if the question is simple, but you may receive a response advising we meet in person.</p>

        <p>Please understand backlog of students waiting to meet with me during extra hours. It is perfectly fine for you to code with other students, get their feedback &mdash; maybe even a solution! &mdash; while you wait. I actually encourage this because it's just the reality of working in a collaborative environment. (This is why I like "Hack Night" over a classroom. &#x1F60A;)</p>

        <p>If you put in the time to wait, I try my best (accounting for mental and physical limitations) to stay and help.</p>

        <p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
